## Concepts to Read Up On

**CI/CD fundamentals**
- [What is CI/CD?](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-ci-cd) — Red Hat's plain-English explanation, good background reading

- [YAML Lint](https://www.yamllint.com/) — paste your YAML here to check for indentation errors before pushing

**Security**
- [Security hardening for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions) — covers secrets, OIDC, and why you never hardcode credentials in YAML
- [Principle of least privilege](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/best-practices) — why the `permissions` block in Challenge 2 only requests what it needs

## Troubleshooting

**Pipeline not triggering**
Make sure your file is in exactly `.github/workflows/` at the root of the repo, and that the branch name in `on: push: branches:` matches your actual branch name.

**Secret not found**
Secret names are case-sensitive. `AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME` and `azure_webapp_name` are different. Double-check the name in your YAML matches exactly what you created in Settings → Secrets.

**OIDC login failing**
The federated credential in Entra ID must match your repo name and branch exactly. Also confirm the App Registration has been assigned a role (Contributor or higher) on the Web App or subscription — without that, login succeeds but deploy will be denied.

**SSH connection refused (Challenge 3)**
Check that port 22 is open on your VM: Azure Portal → VM → Networking → Inbound port rules. Also confirm the public key on the VM matches the private key stored in your secret.

**PM2 app not restarting**
Run `pm2 list` on the VM to check the app name matches your `PM2_APP_NAME` secret exactly. If the app was never started with `pm2 start` first, the `pm2 restart` command will fail — make sure the one-time setup steps were completed.

**Deployment succeeds but site shows old version**
Azure App Service can take a minute or two to swap in the new code. Hard refresh the browser (`Ctrl + Shift + R`) and wait 60 seconds before assuming something is wrong.
